## referencing files with full URL
This repo uses the github pages feature.
e.g. all files can be accessed by using the URL:

http://openconnectivityfoundation.github.io/core/

and then use the filename + path to get the full url.

for example to reference the swagger file with rt type = oic.wk.mnt :

http://openconnectivityfoundation.github.io/core/swagger2.0/oic.wk.mnt.swagger.json
